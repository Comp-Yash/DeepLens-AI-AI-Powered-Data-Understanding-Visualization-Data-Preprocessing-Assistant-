DeepLens AI – AI-Powered Data Understanding, Visualization & Preprocessing Assistant
Project Overview
DeepLens AI is an AI-powered data analysis tool designed to help users understand, preprocess, and visualize datasets efficiently. It leverages Google’s Gemini AI to provide insights, feature analysis, application suggestions, and AI-driven visualizations for any uploaded dataset.

With DeepLens AI, users can:
✅ Upload datasets and get an instant summary (preview, statistics, and unique values).
✅ Get AI-driven insights about dataset applications, important features, and preprocessing steps.
✅ Generate AI-suggested visualizations including scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts.
✅ Ask AI-powered questions about the dataset and receive intelligent responses.

Key Features
🔹 1. Upload & Analyze
Users can upload a CSV dataset, which is automatically processed and analyzed.

The app provides a quick preview, data types, and descriptive statistics of the dataset.

Extracts unique values for categorical features to aid in data understanding.

🔹 2. AI-Powered Data Insights & Preprocessing
The AI analyzes the dataset and provides:

Possible applications of the dataset (e.g., real estate price prediction, sales forecasting).

Key features to focus on for meaningful insights.

Step-by-step preprocessing recommendations for cleaning and preparing the dataset.

🔹 3. AI-Generated & Manual Visualizations
AI suggests which features to plot against each other for analysis.

Users can generate AI-suggested plots, including:

Scatter plots for feature relationships.

Pie charts for categorical distributions.

Bar charts for comparisons.

Users can also manually generate histograms for numerical data.

🔹 4. AI Chat with the Dataset
Users can ask custom AI-powered questions related to their dataset.

AI provides detailed responses, helping with data interpretation, preprocessing, and insights.

Example questions:

"How can I use this dataset for business insights?"

"Which features are most important for prediction?"

"What preprocessing steps are needed for machine learning?"

Technologies Used
🚀 Streamlit – For interactive web-based data analysis.
📊 Pandas & Matplotlib – For data processing and visualization.
🤖 Google Gemini AI (Generative Model) – For AI-powered insights and feature analysis.
