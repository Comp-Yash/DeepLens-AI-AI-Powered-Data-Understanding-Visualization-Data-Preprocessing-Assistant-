DeepLens AI – AI-Powered Data Understanding, Visualization & Preprocessing Assistant
Project Overview
DeepLens AI is an AI-powered data analysis tool designed to help users understand, preprocess, and visualize datasets efficiently. It leverages Google’s Gemini AI to provide:

Insights & feature analysis

Application suggestions

AI-driven visualizations for any uploaded dataset

With DeepLens AI, users can:
✅ Upload datasets and get an instant summary (preview, statistics, and unique values).
✅ Get AI-driven insights about dataset applications, important features, and preprocessing steps.
✅ Generate AI-suggested visualizations including scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts.
✅ Ask AI-powered questions about the dataset and receive intelligent responses.

Key Features
🔹 1. Upload & Analyze
Users can upload a CSV dataset, which is automatically processed and analyzed.

The app provides:

Quick preview of data

Data types & descriptive statistics

Unique values for categorical features to aid in data understanding

🔹 2. AI-Powered Data Insights & Preprocessing
The AI analyzes the dataset and provides:
✔️ Possible applications of the dataset (e.g., real estate price prediction, sales forecasting)
✔️ Key features to focus on for meaningful insights
✔️ Step-by-step preprocessing recommendations for cleaning and preparing the dataset

🔹 3. AI-Generated & Manual Visualizations
AI suggests which features to plot against each other for analysis.
Users can generate AI-suggested plots, including:
📌 Scatter plots for feature relationships
📌 Pie charts for categorical distributions
📌 Bar charts for comparisons
📌 Histograms for numerical data (manual generation available)

🔹 4. AI Chat with the Dataset
Users can ask custom AI-powered questions related to their dataset.

AI provides detailed responses to help with:

Data interpretation

Preprocessing

Insights

Example questions:
💬 "How can I use this dataset for business insights?"
💬 "Which features are most important for prediction?"
💬 "What preprocessing steps are needed for machine learning?"
